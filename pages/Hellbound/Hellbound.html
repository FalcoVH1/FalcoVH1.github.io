      <h2>HELLBOUND</h2>
      <h5>april - june, 2023</h5>

      <p>
        Hellbound is a top down procedural hack n slash made in 12 weeks as a student game at BUas. The game was built on the Perry Engine, a student built engine made entirely in C++.
        On this project, I was one of 2 gameplay programmers, and did all the logic for the character, together with some logic for the boss' attacks and AI. I also did all the animations for
        the character, helped with the VFX, and worked on verious other features throughout development.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        This project was interesting, because artists and designers couldn't really interact with the engine directly due to it's limitations. This meant that I was responsible for collaborating
        with both design and art for a lot of work. This includes but is not limited to; working together with the character artist to make sure the meshes are imported correctly (also so the mesh is
        set up properly to be animated in game), implementing features for designers and iterating on them with their feedback, collaborating with art to implement VFX, etc...
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I think this was a very valuable learning moment for me, as got a lot of practical experience collaborating with peers of different disciplines on a pretty unique project, where I had to become
        quite knowledgeable of many different aspects of our development pipeline.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        All in all, with all the bugs and oddities that were admittedly present in the engine, and even though it took a lot of work, I think the team brought Hellbound to a good spot before releasing it
        on itch.io, where it has garnered 1,674 views and 256 downloads.
